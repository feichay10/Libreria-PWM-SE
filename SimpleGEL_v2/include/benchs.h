/*! @defgroup benchs Benchmark Operations

   The benchmark functions are designed to benchmark some piece of
   code in a precise and deterministic manner.  Interrupts are masked
   during the benchmark.  The benchmark uses the free running counter
   that exists in 68HC11 and 68HC12 (see \c get_timer_counter ).  The
   implementation assumes that the free running counter can overflow
   only once during a benchmark.  This imposes a restrictions on the
   benchmarked operation: they must be fast enough to not exceed
   65536 times the update of the free running counter. For example
   on a 68HC11 @ 8Mhz they should not exceed 32ms.

   The benchmark data is recorded in the \c bench_t data type.
   It must be initialized using \c bench_init. For example:

   <pre>
       bench_t b;

       bench_init (&b);
   </pre>

   Then, the piece of code that must be benchmarked is enclosed by
   calls to \c bench_start and \c bench_stop as follows:

   <pre>
       bench_start (&b);
       ...
       bench_stop (&b);
       bench_report (&b, "Operation");
   </pre>

   The \c bench_report function must be called to compute the time
   and print the result.
