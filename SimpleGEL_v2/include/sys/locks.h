/*! @defgroup locks Locking operations

   Locking operations are defined to allow the use of two strategies to
   protect critical sections from interrupts:

   <dl>
   <dt>Lock/Unlock
   <dd>
      This simple strategy consists in disabling interrupts (sei) and
      enabling them after the critical section.  In general,
      this method assumes the processor accepts interrupts when lock()
      is called.  This strategy is not suitable to implement functions
      that will be called with interrupts masked because this will create
      a side-effect: enable interrupts.

      <p>
      Example:
      <pre>
        lock ();
        ...
        unlock ();
      </pre>

   <dt>Lock/Restore
   <dd>
      This strategy is suitable to protect critical sections in
      functions that will be called with interrupts masked.
      The processor mask is saved before locking interrupts.
      It is restored at the end of the critical section.  When entering
      the critical section, if interrupts are masked, they will
      remain masked at end of critical section.  There is no side effect.

      <p>
      Example:
      <pre>
        unsigned short mask;

        mask = lock ();
        ...
        restore (mask);
      </pre>
    </dl>
